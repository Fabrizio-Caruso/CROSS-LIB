What is CPCfs?

	CPCfs is a program to maintain filesystems that are needed by some
	CPC emulators (especially CPCEmu by Marco Vieth).

	If you are familiar with some emulators, you may have already
	encountered the problem, how to copy files form DOS into the
	image of an emulator, or vice versa.

	The methods described in the documentation of CPCEmu only deal
	with transferring whole CPC disks to CPCEmu diskimages, but not
	single files. 

	If you use CPCEmu you can use the cassette interface to load and save
	files from the CPC memory to DOS files. But this method lacks
	some (in my sense important) features, e.g. 
	- transferring files > 42k
	- transferring data files without Amsdos-Header
	- installing CP/M, if you don't have a 5 1/4 inch drive at your
	  CPC and can't copy whole disks.
	- transferring is so slow as the emulator
	- you can't transfer files in a batch

	If you don't use another emulator than CPCEmu, I do not know
	another solution other than CPCfs.


What other products do I need?

	- A CPC-Emulator (CPCEmu, CPE, SimCPC, CPCEmuII, ...)
	- A CPC Computer with CP/M License, if you want to copy CP/M
	  to an image.


How do I install CPCfs?

	Just unpack the archive with the -d switch to extract the 
	subdirectory src. If you omit the -d switch, you get all files
	in one directory. Then copy the	*.EXE files, CPCFS.CFG and 
	CPCFS.HLP to a place where they can be found (somewhere in the
	path) or where you like them to be. CPCFS.CFG must be in the 
	current directory or in the same directory as CPCFS.EXE.


What is new in version 0.85?

	Main features:
	- Vortex images are now supported
	- User areas and file attributes are fully supported
	- Extensible help system containing nearly the same as the manual
	- Commands can be controlled by options
	- History mechanism

	New comamnds:
	- COPY		copy files
	- TYPE		look at files
	- DPB		see the complete Disk Parameter Block
	- COMMENT	describes your images
	- ATTRIB	change file attributes

	Extended commands:
	- DIR		shows long output, including Amsdos header
	- DUMP		now addresses single sectors or blocks
	- HELP		accesses the online manual
