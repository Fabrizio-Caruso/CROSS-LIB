There is a new \fIsrec_cat \-\-address\[hy]length\fP option, so that you can set
the length of the address fields in the output file.  For example, if you
always want S3 data records in a Motorola hex file, use the
\f[CW]\-\-address\[hy]length=4\fP option.
This helps when talking to brain\[hy]dead EPROM programmers which do not
fully implement the format specification.

There is a new \fI\-\-multiple\fP option to the commands, which permits
an input file to contain multiple (contradictory) values for some memory
locations.  The last value in the file will be used.
