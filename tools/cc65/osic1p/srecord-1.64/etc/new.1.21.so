default, you can turn it off with the \-no\[hy]const option.  The \-C\[hy]Array
output format can now generate an additional include file if you use the
\-INClude option.
This answers SourceForge feature request 942132.

There is a new \-ignore\[hy]checksum command line option.
The \-ignore\[hy]checksums option may be used to disable checksum
validation of input files, for those formats which have
checksums at all.  Note that the checksum values are still read
in and parsed (so it is still an error if they are missing) but
their values are not checked.
