Luc Steynen <LucSteynen@edna.be> discovered that the
\-hecksum\[hy]big\[hy]endian opion was a counter\[hy]intuitive alias for
the the \-checksum\[hy]bitnot\[hy]big\[hy]endian option.
The \-checksum\[hy]big\[hy]endian option is now deprecated, in favor
of the \-checksum\[hy]bitnot\[hy]big\[hy]endian option; the code will warn
uers of the old option they will need to change.
Ditto little\[hy]endian variants
