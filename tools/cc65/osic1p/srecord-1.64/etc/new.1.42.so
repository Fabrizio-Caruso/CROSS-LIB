The \f[I]srec\[hy]cat \-data\[hy]only\fP option has been broken down into four
separate controls.  It is now possible to \fB\-enable\fP and \fB\-disable\fP
individual features, such as \[lq]header\[rq], \[lq]data\[hy]count\[rq],
\[lq]execution\[hy]start\[hy]address\[rq] and \[lq]footer\[rq].
See \f[I]srec_cat\fP(1) for more information.

The \f[I]srec_cat \-start\[hy]address\fP option has been renamed
\fB\-execution\[hy]start\[hy]address\fP to remove any confusion with the
\fB\-offset\fP filter.  The documentation now explicitly explains the
difference between the two.
