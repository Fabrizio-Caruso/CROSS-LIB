bbcim: BBC microcomputer diskimage manipulation program
-------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.1, 16-4-2017.

This is the final version of the original bbcim program that was released way back in 1996, and which was based on a combination of a few separate utility programs that I had released in 1995 to do BBC micro computer diskimage manipulation on a PC which when combined into a single program I expanded with lots of functions.

In 2009 I revised the old and trusted 0.95-beta 5 to fix several small issues, the last update being bbcim 0.95-beta 11 which I released on 20 May 2009. After those 6 updates I should have named it 1.0, which after some more cleanups is what I did in 2014, and now I finally decided to support long filenames in the 1.0 branch of bbcim, so this is version 1.0.1

See the file src/bbcim.c for a version history and you can select some compile time changes there too, such as to give messages in Dutch instead of English. For a unix like OS you don't need to change anything there.
