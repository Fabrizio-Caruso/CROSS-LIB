There is a new warning issued when input data records are not in
strictly ascending address order.  There is a new command line option to

The command line processing of all srecord commands now understands
\f[CW]@\fP\fIfile\fP command line options, filled with additional space
separated strings witch will be treated as of they were command line
options.  This gets around absurdly short command line length limits in
some operating systems.
