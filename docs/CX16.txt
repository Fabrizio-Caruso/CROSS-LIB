
VERA ports:
In a nutshell the values at $9F20, $9F21 & $9F22 specify a starting VRAM address and an auto-increment value (in $9F22).   Reading $9F23 reads the next VRAM byte.
Writing $9F23 writes the next VRAM byte.

----

For example:
   $9F20 = 0
   $9F21 = 0
   $9F22 = %00010001 

This points at VRAM address 65536 with Auto Increment value of 1

----

Bit 0 of $9F22 is considered the bank  the rest of the bits in 22 set the auto increment mode   
The address is Little Endian from $9F20 to the bank bit in $22

HSCALE = ( DESIRED RES/640 ) * 128
VSCALE = (DESIREDRES/480) * 128
