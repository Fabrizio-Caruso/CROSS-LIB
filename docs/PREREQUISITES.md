## Prerequisites

- [Non-UNIX only] Install a POSIX environment if necessary, e.g., Cygwin.
- Install `make` in your environment.
- Install `python` (2.x or 3.x)
- Install the required cross-compilers
- [Only for some compilers] Make sure they are either installed as described in the Makefile variables: `Z88DK_PATH`, `CC65_PATH`, `LCC1802_PATH`, etc. or set these variables accordingly.
- [Z88DK-only] Select the optimization level in Makefile by setting the variables: `SCZZ80_OPTS` (`-O3` for highest optimizations), `ZSDCC_OPTS` (`-SO3` for high optimizations; `-SO3 --max-allocs-per-node200000` for highest and extremely slow optimizations).
- [Native builds only] Install `gcc` and `ncurses`
