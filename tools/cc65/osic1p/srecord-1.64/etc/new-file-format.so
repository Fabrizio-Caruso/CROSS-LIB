.SH NAME
How to add a new file format
.XX "" "How to add a new file format"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This section describes how to add a new file format.  It's mostly a
set of reminders for the maintainer.  If you want a format added to
the distribution, use this method and e\[hy]mail the maintainer a patch
(generated with \f[CW]diff \-Nur\fP, usually) and it can be added to the
sources if appropriate.
.SS New Files
The directory hierarchy is an echo of the class hierarchy, making it
easy to guess the filename of a class, and to work out the appropriate
file name of a new class.  You get used to it.  It is suggested that you
simply work in the root of the source tree (exploiting tab\[hy]completion in
your shell and your editor) rather than continually changing directories
up and down the source tree.  All of the file names below assume this.
.PP
The following files need to be creates for a new format.
.TP 8n
srecord/output/file/\f[I]name\fP.cc
This file is how to write the new format.
Take a look at the other files in the same directory
for examples.  Also check out \f[I]srecord/output/file.h\fP and
\f[I]srecord/output.h\fP for various helper methods.
.TP 8n
srecord/output/file/\f[I]name\fP.h
This is the class declaration for the above file.
.TP 8n
srecord/input/file/\f[I]name\fP.cc
This file is how to read the new format.
Take a look at the other files in the same directory
for examples.  Also check out \f[I]srecord/input/file.h\fP and
\f[I]srecord/input.h\fP for various helper methods.
.TP 8n
srecord/input/file/\f[I]name\fP.h
This is the class declaration for the above file.
.TP 8n
man/man5/srec_\f[I]name\fP.5
.RS
This file describes the format.  Take a look at the other files in the
same directory for examples.
.PP
If you need to describe something as \[lq]stupid\[rq],
as is all too often the case,
use \f[CW]thesaurus.com\fP to find a synonym.
Use the following command
.RS
\f[CW]find man/. \-type f | xargs grep \-i \fP\f[I]synonym\fP
.RE
to make sure it hasn't been used yet.
.RE
.TP 8n
test/\f[I]nn\fP/t\f[I]nnmm\fPa.sh
.RS
You may have noticed that SRecord comes with a lot of tests.  You are
more likely to get the patch for your new format accepted rapidly if it
comes with at least one test for its output class, and at least one test
for its input class.
.PP
If your filter has endian\[hy]ness, add tests for each endian.
.RE
.SS Modified Files
The following files need to be updated to mention the new format.
.TP 8n
srecord/srecord.h
Add the new include file to the list.  This file controls what files are
installed into the \f[CW]/usr/include\fP directory.  Not all of them,
just the public interface.
.TP 8n
etc/README.man
Mention the new format in the section of this file which describes
the supported file formats.
.TP 8n
etc/index.html
Mention the new format in the section of this file which describes
the supported file formats.
.TP 8n
srecord/arglex/tool.h
.RS
Add the new format to the command line argument type enum.
.PP
If your filter has endian\[hy]ness, add one for each endian, using
\[lq]_be\[rq] and \[lq]_le\[rq] suffixes.
.RE
.TP 8n
srecord/arglex/tool.cc
.RS
Add the new format to the array of command line arguments types.
.PP
If your filter has endian\[hy]ness, add one for each endian, using
\[lq]_Big_Endian\[rq] and \[lq]_Little_Endian\[rq] suffixes.
.RE
.TP 8n
srecord/arglex/tool/input.cc
Add the new format to the code which parses input formats.
.TP 8n
srecord/arglex/tool/output.cc
Add the new format to the code which parses output formats.
.TP 8n
srecord/input/file/guess.cc
Add the new format to the list of formats which are tested.
.TP 8n
man/man1/srec_input.1
Mention the new format in the section of this file which describes
the supported input file formats.
.TP 8n
man/man1/srec_cat.1
Mention the new format in the section of this file which describes
the supported output file formats.
.TP 8n
Makefile
Actually, the system the maintainer uses automatically generates this
file, but if you aren't using Aegis you will need to edit this file for
your own use.
.SS Tests
You may have noticed that SRecord comes with a lot of tests.  You are
more likely to get the patch for your new format accepted rapidly if it
comes with at least one test for its output class, and at least one test
for its input class.
.PP
If your filter has endian\[hy]ness, add tests for each endian.
.SH IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
In implementing a new file format, there are a couple of philosophical
issues which affect technical decisions:
.TP 8n
Be liberal in what you accept
Where ever possible, consume the widest possible interpretation of
valid data.  This includes treating mandatory input fields as optional
(\f[I]e.g.\fP file headers and execution start addresses), and coping
with input definitions to their logical extremes (\f[I]e.g.\fP 255 byte
data records in Motorola format).
Checksums should always be checked on input, only ignore them if the
\-ignore\[hy]checksums command line option has been given.
Absurd line lengths must be tolerated.
.TP 8n
Be conservative in what you produce
Even when the input is questionable, the output produced by
\f[I]srec_cat\fP must always be strictly conforming with the format
definition (except as mandated by command line options, see below).
Checksums, if the format has them, must always be correct on output.
Line lengths should default to something reasonable (about 80 characters
or less).
.TP 8n
Eat Your Own Dog Food
You input class must always be able to consume what your output class
produces, no matter what combination of command line options (see below)
has been selected.
.TP 8n
Round Trip
.RS
.TP 3n
In general, what went in is what comes out.
.TP 3n
\(bu
The data may be re\[hy]arranged in order, the line lengths may change, but
the same data should go out as came in.
(The data should be unchanged even if the format changed,
assuming equally capable formats.)
The \f[I]srec_cmp\fP(1) command may be used to verify this.
.TP 3n
\(bu
If the input has no header record, the output should not have one either
(if at all possible).  This means not automatically inserting a header
record if the output file code sees data as the first method call.
(The \-disable=header option affects this, too.)
.TP 3n
\(bu
If the input has no execution start address record, the output should
not have one either (if at all possible).  This means not automatically
inserting an execution start address record if the output file code does
not see one by the time the destructor is called.
(The \-disable=exec\[hy]start\[hy]addr flag affects this, too.)
.TP 3n
\(bu
Write at least one \f[B]test\fP that does a \[lq]round trip\[rq] of
data through the new format and back again, exercising any interesting
boundary conditions along the way (\f[I]e.g.\fP data records spanning
segment boundaries).
.RE
.TP 8n
Holes
Do not to fill in holes in the data.  That said, sometimes you
\f[I]have\fP to fill holes in the data.  This happens, for example, when
a 16\[hy]bit format is faced with an 8\[hy]bit byte of data for one or other
half of a 16\[hy]bit word.
If there is no other way around it, call the fatal_alignment_error method,
which will suggest a suitable input filter.
.SH OPTIONS
There are also some command line arguments you will need to take into account:
.TP 8n
\f[B]\-address\[hy]length\fP
This options is used to specify the minimum address length, if your new
format has a choice about how many bytes of address it produces.
.TP 8n
\f[B]\-data\[hy]only\fP
This option implies all of the \f[B]\-disable=header\fP,
\f[B]\-disable=data\[hy]count\fP \f[B]\-disable=exec\[hy]start\[hy]addr\fP and
\f[B]\-disable=footer\fP options.
Only the essential data records are produced.
.TP 8n
\f[B]\-disable=header\fP
If this option is used, no header records are to be produced (or minimal
header records).  This is available as the \f[CW]enable_header_flag\fP
class variable in the methods of your derived class.
.TP 8n
\f[B]\-disable=data\[hy]count\fP
If this option is used, no data record count records are to be produced.
This is available as the \f[CW]enable_data_count_flag\fP class variable
in the methods of your derived class.
.TP 8n
\f[B]\-disable=exec\[hy]start\[hy]addr\fP
If this option is used, no execution start address records are to be
produced.  This is available as the \f[CW]enable_goto_addr_flag\fP class
variable in the methods of your derived class.
.TP 8n
\f[B]\-disable=footer\fP
If this option is used, no end\[hy]of\[hy]file records are to be produced.  This
is available as the \f[CW]enable_footer_flag\fP class variable in the
methods of your derived class.
.TP 8n
\fB\-enable=optional\[hy]address
If this option is used, in combination with a format that does not have
an address on every line, the the first zero address many be omitted.
All subsequent addresses are not optional, just the first zero address.
Defaults to disabled.
.TP 8n
\f[B]\-ignore\[hy]checksums\fP
If this flag is set, your file input methods must parse \f[I]but not
check\fP checksums, if the format has checksums.  You can tell if you
need to use checksums by calling the \f[CW]use_checksums()\fP method
within the implementation of your derived class.  This only applies to
input; output must always produce correct checksums.
.TP 8n
\f[B]\-line\[hy]length\fP
Where your output format is text, and there exists the possibility of
putting more or less text on each line (\f[I]e.g.\fP the Motorola format
allows a variable number of data bytes per record) then this should be
controllable.  This manifests in the \f[CW]address_length_set\fP and
\f[CW]preferred_block_size_get\fP methods you must implement in your
derived class.
