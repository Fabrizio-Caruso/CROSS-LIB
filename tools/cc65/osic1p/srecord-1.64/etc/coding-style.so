.SH CODING STYLE
Please following the coding style of the existing code.
It makes your patches and contributions more likely to be accepted
if they don't have to be extensively reformatted.
.PP
Indent increments are four characters.
Do not use tab characters at all,
nobody can agree how wide they are supposed to be.
Line length is 80 characters or fewer, no exceptions.
.PP
Please follow the existing convention of
always using Doxygen comments on all your instance variables and methods,
even for private methods.
Always document all arguments of all methods, even private methods,
using \f[CW]@param\fP tags; see existing style.
Always use whole sentences in your Doxygen documentation,
see existing code for examples.
.PP
Do not use upper case letters in file names.
Do not use white space or shell special characters in file names.
.PP
When sending a patch please use \[lq]diff \-Nur\[rq], as this will
include your new files in the patch, and you will not need additional
attachments in your email.  Patches are preferred over tarballs.
.PP
Include tests.
It makes your patches and contributions more likely to be accepted
if the maintainer doesn't have to write your tests for you.
See sources for examples of existing tests.
.SH CONTRACT RATES
It is possible to have the maintainer write your new file format or new
filter for you.  However, if you want it done for nothing, you will be
put at the end of a (very) long queue of other \f[I]gratis\fP open
source work the maintainer has yet to do.  You can jump the queue if you
want to pay the maintainer to do the work for you.
.PP
The maintainer's rates are AU$100 per hour.
.PP
A well document new format typically takes six hours to write and
test, this includes both reading and writing the new format.  A well
documented new filter typically takes three hours to write and test.
.PP
Examples make these tasks easier.
Poor documentation makes these tasks take longer.
A mystery format that requires reverse engineering may take \f[I]much\fP
longer; ask again once you have figured it out.
.PP
All code written for you will be included in the project source tarball
in its next release.  All formats and filters written for you will be
copyright Scott Finneran;E\[hy]Mail:;scottfinneran@yahoo.com.au, and
they will be GNU GPL licensed.  If you \f[I]need\fP a format or filter
written, it has value to you; the issue of freeloaders is irrelevant.
.PP
Conversely, integrating complete open source contributions and patches
is done \f[I]gratis\fP, and usually done as promptly as time permits.
