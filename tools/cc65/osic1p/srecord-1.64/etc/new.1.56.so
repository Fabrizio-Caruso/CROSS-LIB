The byte order of the fletcher16 output has been reversed.

.\" Change 22
The meaning of the \fB\-address\[hy]length\fP option has been change for
the Intel output format. Previously, 2 meant using i16hex 20\[hy]bit
segmented addressing, and >2 meant using i32hex extended
addressing. This has been changed: a value of 2 requests i8hex
16\[hy]bit addressing, a value of 3 requests i16hex 20\[hy]bit segment
addressing, and a value >=4 requests i32hex 32\[hy]bit addressing.
My thanks to Stephen R. Phillips \f[CW]<srp@CSECorporation.com>\fP for
reporting the absence of i8hex support.

The \fB\-generate \-repeat\[hy]string\fP option is now able to take a
string that looks like a number as the text to be repeated. My

reporting this problem.

Luca Giancristofaro \f[CW]<luca.giancristofaro@prosa.com>\fP discovered a
WinAVR linker that is a sandwich short of a picnic: it generated
non\[hy]conforming Intel hex end\[hy]of\[hy]file records.  This is no longer
an error, but only a warning.

There were some problems with the RPM spec file, these have been
improved.  My thanks to Galen Seitz \f[CW]<galens@seitzassoc.com>\fP for
reporting this problem.
