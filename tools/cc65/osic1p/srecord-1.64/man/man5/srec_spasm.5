.TH \*(n) 5 SRecord "Reference Manual"
.SH NAME
srec_spasm \- SPASM file format
.if require_index \{
.XX "srec_spasm(5)" "SPASM file format"
.\}
.SH DESCRIPTION
This format is the output of the Paralax SPASM assembler
(now defunct, I'm told).
The file contains two columns of 16\[hy]bit hexadecimal coded values.
The first column is the word address, the second column is the word data.
.PP
By default, SRecord treats this is big\[hy]endian data (the most
significant byte first).  If you want little endian order,
use the \-spasm\[hy]le argument instead.
.SS Size Multiplier
In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 5.0 times
when represented with this format (5.5 times in Windows).
