Added Sourceforge Patch #4 contributed by Stas
Sergeev <stsp@sourceforge.net> which contributed get_upper_bound() and makes
it and the lower equivalent public (for use from libsrecord).
Also fixed a bug in srec_memory::find_next_chunk() where it
would fail to reset the find_next_chunk_index once it became
equal to nchunks. After that, find_next_chunk() would always
fail.

Added prefix and postfix strings to the C Array format which are
applied at each end of the data array declaration. This allows
the user to add various compiler directives such as location
flags or non\[hy]standard load address specifiers.

Fixed Sourceforge bug 11 raised by patryks. In the analysis, it
was discovered that a start address (of zero) was being
