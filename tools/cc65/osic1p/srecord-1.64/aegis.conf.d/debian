can perform many different manipulations.\n\
.\n\
The tools include:\n\
 * The srec_cat program may be used to catenate (join) EPROM load files, or\n\
   portions of EPROM load files, together. Because it understands all of the\n\
   input and output formats, it can also be used to convert files from one\n\
   format to another. It also understands filters.\n\
 * The srec_cmp program may be used to compare EPROM load files, or portions\n\
   of EPROM load files, for equality.\n\
 * The srec_info program may be used to print summary information about EPROM\n\
   load files.";
