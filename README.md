*Cross-Lib* and games built with it (e.g., Chase, Shoot, Bomber, Snake, Horde, Verbix, Shuriken, Stinger, Trex)

by Fabrizio Caruso (fabrizio_caruso@hotmail.com)

*Cross-Lib* is a *WORA* (Write Once Run Anywhere) framework for vintage systems, i.e., 
you code your game in C **once** and *Cross-Lib* builds the very same game for about 200 vintage systems (console, computers, etc.) with **the very same code**.

## CURRENTLY SUPPORTED SYSTEMS AND ARCHITECTURES

Cross-Lib can be used to build games for about 200 different vintage systems (computers, consoles, arcade boards, pocket calculators, etc.). 
An almost complete list of the supported systems with their status is in: <a href="https://github.com/Fabrizio-Caruso/CROSS-LIB/blob/master/docs/STATUS.md"><b>Supported Systems</b></a>


Some supported vintage CPU architectures are:

- RCA 1802 
- Intel 8080 
- MOS 6502 
- Motorola 6803 
- Motorola 6809
- TMS 9900
- Zilog 80 

Cross-Lib has also some experimental support for vintage 16-bit and 32-bit systems and for the native PC.

For a more complete list of architectures you can look at: <a href="https://github.com/Fabrizio-Caruso/CROSS-LIB/blob/master/docs/ARCHITECTURES.md"><b>Architectures</b></a>


-------------------------------------------

## INSTALLATION

An installation is not strictly necessary because Cross-Lib can be used through GitHub Codespaces on any browser.
For an actual installation you can use
- the pre-built docker image, 
- the dockerfile to build an image or 
- a clone of this repository, which requires some dependencies (compilers and a few tools).

For the details click on <a href="https://github.com/Fabrizio-Caruso/CROSS-LIB/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md"><b>Installation</b></a>


-------------------------------------------

## THE `xl` SCRIPT

Inside the project main directory, you find the `src` and the `build` directories:
- `src` contains the source code and all other files that are necessary to build the games and the examples;
- `build` is supposed to be empty at first and it is the target directory for the build process.

First of all you need to be in the `src` directory.
From `src` you can use the `xl` script  to do different operations on projects.


`xl` is used as follows:
```
xl <command> <[optional] parameters>
```

You can get help with:
```
xl help <[optional] command>
```

You can build games and examples with :

`xl <game_or_example_name> <[optional] system_name>`

For example `xl snake vic20` builds the *snake* for the *Commodore Vic 20 +16K* and `xl stinger` builds *stinger* for the *native terminal*.

-------------------------------------------

## THE TOOL-CHAIN

Cross-Lib provides a full tool-chain to build universal vintage 8-bit games. 

### Cross-Lib components

Cross-Lib provides:
- a C library with hardware-agnostic APIs for game development;
- the "user-friendly" script `xl`.



### The build process

When a game is built for a specific target, the Cross-Lib tool-chain will automatically:
1. if needed, convert the abstract graphics assets in graphics assets for the given target on the fly;
2. compile the game code (and the target-specific game assets) by using the appropriate compiler;
3. if needed, whenever possible, create a disk/cassette/cartridge image.

The user has to
- code the game in C with Cross-Lib APIs;
- draw the graphics assets in the *tiles* directory;
- run the `xl` script (see below).

### The compilers

Code written in C with Cross-Lib can be compiled by several different cross-compilers and natively on the PC.

The tool-chain currently supports: `CC65`, `Z88DK` (`SCCZ80` and `ZSDCC`), `CMOC`, `LCC1802`, `ACK`, `XTC68`, `GCC`, `GCC-Z8K`, `GCC-ATARI-ST`, `GCC-AMIGA`, `GCC-TI`, `VBCC`, `CC6303`.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Cross-Lib would not exist without the cross-compilers and the support of their developers and the support of some people who have helped me handle the input/output of some targets.
