@The srecord package is a collection of powerful tools for manipulating EPROM
load files. It reads and writes numerous EPROM file formats, and can perform
many different manipulations.

The tools include:
 * The srec_cat program may be used to catenate (join) EPROM load files, or
   portions of EPROM load files, together. Because it understands all of the
   input and output formats, it can also be used to convert files from one
   format to another. It also understands filters.
 * The srec_cmp program may be used to compare EPROM load files, or portions
   of EPROM load files, for equality.
 * The srec_info program may be used to print summary information about EPROM
   load files.@;
