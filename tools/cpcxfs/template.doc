----
        CPCFS - CPCEmu Filesystem Maintenance           Version: 0.85


SYNOPSIS
--------
        CPCFS                   to invoke an interactive session
        CPCFS <commands> ...    to perform batch commands


DESCRIPTION
-----------
CPCFS is a program to copy files form a DOS filesystem to a
disk-image appropriate for CPCEmu, an emulator for the
CPC464/664/6128 homecomputer series by Amstrad.

Note:	This documentation is generated out of CPCfs' help file CPCFS.HLP.
	Some "See also"-hints can therefore be misleading!


INVOCATION
----------
~invocation~
Options are simply a shortcut for commands. The first argument can
be the name of an imagefile, all following arguments are commands.
If you omit a command and only give <image> ``dir'' is assumed.

~variables~


COMMANDS
--------
All commands are case insensitive. Some commands write an informational
message, if they are invoked without an argument (mode, open, page,
prompt, verbosity,...). Some commands have more names than one. You can
use the name that you like most.

~commands~

~options~


GENERAL commands
================

~open~
Closes the one in memory, if any. It appends the string ".DSK" to the 
DOS filename, if no extension is given.


~close~

~user~


TRANSFER commands
=================

~get~

~mget~

~put~

~mput~

~mode~
Printable characters are newlines (10,13) and characters between space (32)
and tilde (126). <mode> can be abbreviated to its first character B, T, or A. 


~sysgen~
It only works, if the image was formatted with two system tracks (e.g.
system or vortex format). See STAT, if you want to know the format or
whether CP/M is already in the image. 

To obtain a CP/M-image you can use the accompanying BASIC program
GETCPM.BAS. It runs on a CPC and copies the system tracks off a real CPC
disk to the file SYSTEM.CPM. Then transfer the file to DOS.

If you want to "sysgen" your vortex image, you must prepare CP/M first
(see your vortex documentation). WARNING: I do not own a vortex drive
nor its documentation, so I cannot tell if it works. Feedback it
highly appreciated!!!


DOS ACCESS commands
===================

~!~
Executes the program <command> in a DOS-Shell. If only a "!" is
typed, CPCfs invokes the interactive shell given in the %COMSPEC% 
environment variable or C:\COMMAND.COM if the variable isn't set. You
must type EXIT to return from the shell to CPCfs. Contrary to other 
commands there is no space needed behind the "!".


~cd~

The "L" in LCD (as well as in LDIR) reminds you, that this command 
affects the local filesystem of DOS.


~ldir~


CP/M MAINTENANCE commands
=========================

Informational
-------------

~dir~

~stat~

~dpb~
~background~

~comment~

~type~

~dump~

Note: Options for DUMP can be packed, but this can be confusing
      E.g. DUMP -B0 -2B5 for blocks 0 to 5
      or   DUMP -12	 for blocks form beginning (1) to the same blook (2)


Changing files
--------------

~format~

~del~

~ren~
REN uses the well-known DOS order for renaming (think of the word TO
between the filenames) and not the (possibly expected) CP/M order (think
of ":=" between the filenames)


~attrib~

~copy~



USER INTERFACE comamnds
=======================

# <any-text>
	This is a comment. Everything upto the next command is ignored.


~quit~
Quits CPCFS. You can hit Ctrl-Z to achieve the same purpose, only faster!


~help~
The startup helppage is:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
~nothing~
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

~source~

~echo~

~prompt~

~cls~

~force~

~verbosity~

~page~
CPCfs has an internal pager for commands like DUMP, TYPE, and so on.
With the PAGE command you can set the number of lines of your screen
(the default is 25). If you set PAGE 0, you bypass the internal pager
and things are displayed without stops.



FILENAMES
---------
~filenames~

EDITING
-------
~editing~

VALUES & PERCENT EXPANSION
--------------------------
~values~
~percent~


FILES
-----
CPCFS.CFG
	The commands in this file are executed every time CPCFS starts in
	interactive mode. You can set the PROMPT here or open an often 
	used image or ...

	CPCFS looks for it at first in the current directory and then in the
	directory where CPCFS.EXE resides.

*.DSK
	This is the default extension for imagfiles

*.CPM
	This is the default extension for CP/M tracks saved by GETCPM.BAS
	and needed by SYSGEN.

SEE ALSO 
-------- 
GETCPM.BAS, a Locomotive BASIC program to copy CP/M tracks off a
diskette and save them to a file. Simply type it in your *original* CPC
(you can leave out REMarks and PRINTs) and run it on a CP/M system disk.
It creates a file, that you have to transfer in some way to DOS (read
the CPCEmu documentation for various ways, how to arrange it). Finally
use CPCfs' SYSGEN command to create a diskimage with CP/M.

DROPTAG.BAT, a batch file replacing DROPTAG.EXE of the former distribution.
