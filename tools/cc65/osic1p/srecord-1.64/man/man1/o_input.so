.SH INPUT FILE SPECIFICATIONS
Input may be qualified in two ways:
you may specify a data file or a data generator.
format and you may specify filters to apply to them.
An input file specification looks like this:
.RS
\f[I]data\[hy]file\fP [ \f[I]filter\fP \&... ]
.br
\f[I]data\[hy]generator\fP [ \f[I]filter\fP \&... ]
.RE
.SS Data Files
Input from data files is
specified by file name and format name.
An input file specification looks like this:
.RS
\f[I]filename\fP [ \f[I]format\fP ][ \-ignore\[hy]checksums ]
.RE
The default format is Motorola S\[hy]Record format,
but \f[I]many\fP others are also understood.
.SS Data Generators
It is also possible to generate data, rather than read it from a file.
You may use a generator anywhere you could use a file.
An input generator specification looks like this:
.RS
\fB\-GENerate\fP \f[I]address\[hy]range\fP \fB\-\fP\f[I]data\[hy]source\fP
.RE
Generators include random data and various forms of constant data.
.SS Common Manual Page
See \f[I]srec_input\fP(1) for complete details of input specifiers.
This description is in a separate manual page
because it is common to more than one SRecord command.
