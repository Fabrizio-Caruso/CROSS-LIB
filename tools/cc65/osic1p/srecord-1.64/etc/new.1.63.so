.\" Change 51
Added more comments to the code, so that the use
of URL_deode for the command line is better explained. And
comment to explain why not to do turl_encode when building
header records.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 17
Added URL quoting to the command line. There are
times you need to be able to insert unprintable characters on
the command line. The immediate use case prompting this was a
user wanting to put a NUL in the header string. So now you can,
as "%00". The other choice was quoted printable encoding, but
that was a bit obscure.
