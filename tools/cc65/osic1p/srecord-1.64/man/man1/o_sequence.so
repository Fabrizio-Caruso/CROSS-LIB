\fB\-Enable_Sequence_Warnings\fP
.RS
This option may be used to enable warnings about input files where the
data records are not in strictly ascending address order.
Only one warning is issued per input file.
This is the default.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP the output of \fIsrec_cat\fP(1) is always in this order.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP This option must be used \f[I]before\fP the input file.
This is because if there are several files on the command line, each may
need different settings.  The setting remains in force until the next
\fB\-Disable_Sequence_Warnings\fP option.
