(1) TMS9900-GCC
https://github.com/mburkley/tms9900-gcc

Very simple instructions are here: https://github.com/mburkley/tms9900-gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#user-download-and-install

-------------------------------------

(2) ACK
https://github.com/davidgiven/ack

Very simple but *time consuming* compilation explained in the main README file.

-------------------------------------

(3) CC6303 for the Motorola 6803-based targets 
https://github.com/zu2/CC6303 (maintained and more recent but not tested yet)
I need to check and see if it works fine.

If the first link fails to build and/or fails to build correct binaries we have this:
https://github.com/EtchedPixels/CC6303 (obsolete and not maintained)

No instructions found but there is a simple Makefile.
So "make all" and probably "make install" (it just copies files to hard-coded locations)

-------------------------------------

(4) VBCC
http://www.compilers.de/vbcc.html

Remark: We need a *multi-target* version. The *multi-target* versions support several targets across different architectures.

I have never built it from source myself. I have always used a pre-built multi-target.
I need to check if it can be easily built.

Source code of the multi-target version is here: http://www.ibaug.de/vbcc/vbcc.tar.gz
