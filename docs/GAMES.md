## VERBIX

![Vic20](/snapshots/XVerbix_Vic20_title.jpg)

Cross Verbix is a word game somehow similar to Scrabble and to a much lesser extent similar to Tetris: you must construct correct English words by rotating columns of letters or by rotating the bottom row before the letters reach the top level.
You can get extra points if you complete the level earlier by lowering the stack of letters below the second row.

CONTROLS: either the joystick or I (up rotate),  J (move left/left rotate), K (down rotate), L(move right, right rotate), SPACE (check word)

## HORDE

![CPC](../snapshots/XHorde_CPC.png)
![Atari](../snapshots/XHorde_A8.png)
![SMS](../snapshots/XHorde_SMS.png)

Cross Horde is a zombie shooter with several different enemies, levels and power-ups and items to pick.

You die if a zombie reaches the wall behind the bow or if a zombie hits you with its bullets.

In order to improve your fire power you can pick up the rings that are dropped when some zombies die.
Rings will improve in this order:
- the range of your bow
- the speed of your bow
- the number of arrows thrown at once 
- the power of your bow
After these improvements, the rings will be necessary to unblock special items and to achieve the temporary "hyper" power.

CONTROLS: either the joystick or J (left), L (right), SPACE (fire).

## SNAKE

![MSX](../snapshots/XSnake_MSX2.png)
![GB](../snapshots/XSnake_GB.png)
![C64](../snapshots/XSnake_C64_intro.png)

This my own re-interpretation of Nibbler (arcade) and Snake (primarily a cell phone game), to which I have added many more game elements.

You have to go through 32 levels (with 16 different maps) + an optional secret level (with its own map).
To complete a level you have to eat all the apples while:
- avoiding your own tail and body
- avoiding the fixed and bouncing mines
- avoiding to starve by losing your energy (eat apples to prevent this).
As you starve, the snake moves faster and faster.

Walls do not kill you and let you pause the game and think about your next move.

You can also catch special items that will help in your quest:
- ring (collect 3 or even 4 for extra points and to spawn more special items such as "freeze")
- freeze (special item that freezes the mines and restores your energy
- $ (extra points... but also some secret effects if you collect many)
- extra life (special and hard to unlock item that gives 1 extra life)

CONTROLS: either the joystick or I J K L to move and SPACE to start/continue.

You can play the game online:

## BOMBER

![Atari](../snapshots/XBomber_A8.png)
 
The game's goal is to destroy all buildings so that you can land on an empty road.
The game is a clone of Air Attack (aka Blitz) game that was first developed on the Commodore Pet.
The game is controlled by the single fire button (first joystick button for targets with joystick input and space key for targets with keyboard input).
Your score depends on the number of building destroyed, the level reached and how fast you complete each single level.
The game has 9 levels and it ends after the eighth level.

CONTROLS: either the joystick fire button or SPACE.
