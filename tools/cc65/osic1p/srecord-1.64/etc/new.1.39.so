.\" Change 15
A bug has been fixed in the calculation of ranges on the command
line, it no longer goes into an infinite loop for "\-fill 0xFF
\-over { foo.hex \-exclude \-within foo.hex }" construct, which
should have been calculating an empty fill set, but was instead
calculating a 4GB fill set.

.\" Change 12
The CRC32 filters now take an \-xmodem option, to use an
xmodem\[hy]like (all bit zero) initial state, rather than the
default CCITT (all bits on) initial state.
