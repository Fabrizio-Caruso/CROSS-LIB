.\" Change 21
A bug has been fixed in the MsBin output, it now concatenates
records correctly, and calaulate checksums appropriately.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 22
It is now possible to ask the Fletcher 16 filter to give you a
specific answer, and adjusting the checksum to achieve that
result. It is also possible to specify different seed values for
the sums.
.TP 2n

.if t \(bu
.\" Change 19
There is a new srec_cat \fB\-enable=optional\[hy]address\fP option to cause
output formats capable of omitting addresses, to omit a leading
zero address, as those formats usually default the address to
zero, if no address information is seen before the first data
record.  Defaults to false (disabled).
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 18
There is a new \f[I]srec_cat\fP(1) \fB\-output\[hy]block\[hy]packing\fP
option, that may be used to pack output records even when they cross
internal SRecord boundaries.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 17
There is a new \f[I]srec_cat\fP(1) \fB\-output\[hy]block\[hy]size\fP so
that you can specify the block size exactly, rather than implying it
with the line length option.
