/*
 * Compare two files using fcomp.  The -w option produces an output of the
 * entire file, with insertions an deletions marked by "change bars" in the
 * left margin.  This is superior to context difference, as it shows the entire
 * file as context.  The -s option could be added to compare runs of white
 * space as equal.
 *
 * This command is used by aed(1) to produce a difference listing when file in
 * the development directory was originally copied from the current version in
 * the baseline.
 *
 * All of the command substitutions described in aesub(5) are available.
 * In addition, the following substitutions are also available:
 *
 * ${ORiginal}
 *      The absolute path name of a file containing the version originally
 *      copied.  Usually in the baseline.
 * ${Input}
 *      The absolute path name of the edited version of the file.  Usually in
 *      the development directory.
 * ${Output}
 *      The absolute path name of the file in which to write the difference
 *      listing.  Usually in the development directory.
 *
 * An exit status of 0 means successful, even of the files differ (and they
 * usually do).  An exit status which is non-zero means something is wrong.
 *
 * The non-zero exit status may be used to overload this command with extra
 * tests, such as line length limits.  The difference files must be produced
 * in addition to these extra tests.
